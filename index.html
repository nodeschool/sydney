					<p>We, the organisers of <strong>NodeSchool Sydney</strong>, are dedicated to providing a harassment-free

						physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment
						of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
						community at the discretion of the organisers of <strong>NodeSchool Sydney</strong>.</p>

					<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression,
						sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious
						beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
						sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
						attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any events at <strong>NodeSchool
							Sydney</strong> meetups or in any related communication channels. Community members asked to stop any
						harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the
						anti-harassment policy.</p>

					<p>If a community member engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers of <strong>NodeSchool Sydney</strong>
						may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.
